          Why Core Skills Matter
        </h2>
        <p className="text-md mb-6 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
          In today&apos;s workforce, possessing technical knowledge alone
          isn&apos;t enough. Core skills such as adaptability, collaboration,
          and creativity are critical for success in dynamic and
          interdisciplinary work environments. Core Skills Hub bridges this gap,
          giving educators the tools to ensure that students are prepared for
          real-world challenges.
